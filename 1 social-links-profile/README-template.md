## My process

I started creating a div for the card and then created the buttons which were very easy to replicate, just made the border-radius bigger got the same color and that was it. But for the text it was a little bit harder, i decided to put them in the same div as the buttons and created divs for each segment of text and firstly, i styled them so it was the same as the design provided and used margins to make the spacing good and used flexbox to make the whole card at the center of the screen, the buttons at a collumn and at the bottom of the card and to make the text centered. After styling the buttons i put the image, made it round with border-radius and made the width smaller.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Code Editor

### What I learned

I learned a lot about flexbox, being able to use it in many parts of my code such as:
.buttons {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;

Learned how to transform an image into an avatar with:
img {
    border-radius: 50%;
}
Improved my margin skills also

### Continued development

I want to improve in flexbox because it's a very important technique in our todays world and i'm still kind of confused in flexbox, also i want to improve my styles, like being able to identify the color, font size etc just by look at the image, acquire more experience at programming, learn a programming language like JavaScript, get better at CSS.
