## Overview

### Screenshot

## My process
I started creating a div for the card, adjusted the height and width, border-radius and background color. Then progressed to the text which was kind of hard, but i just inserted the right font, font-size, margins, font-weight, and thirdly, i inserted the image, adjusted the size, border-radius, margins, and finally, made the margins of the text according to the image. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Code Editor

### What I learned
I learned how to insert fonts at CSS :
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;

ALso i learned why my images weren't being inserted in my previous projects
  <!--<img src="images/image-qr-code.png"/>-->
Remember to not type a "/" before the first file in the src.

### Continued development
I want to get experience making this small projects and be able to do them faster and with more accuracy. I hope i get better at things im bad at like flexbox and grid layout.
